# RAG System Testing Document

This document is a sample for testing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data ingestion pipeline. It contains multiple sentences to demonstrate how text is parsed, chunked, embedded, and indexed.

The primary goal is to ensure that the entire pipeline works end-to-end with a simple, controlled configuration.

*   **RAG** combines information retrieval with text generation to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.
*   **Chunking** involves breaking the document into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces with some overlap to maintain context between chunks.
*   **Embeddings** are numerical representations (vectors) of text chunks used for semantic search in a vector store.

You can test this by asking questions about the content, such as "What is chunking in RAG?" or "What are embeddings?".
